# 🧠 Wavelet-Based Image Feature Extraction using DWT

This project demonstrates **multi-resolution image analysis** using the **Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)**.  
It performs wavelet decomposition on a grayscale image, visualizes sub-bands at multiple levels, and extracts meaningful **statistical features** for further analysis or machine learning tasks.
